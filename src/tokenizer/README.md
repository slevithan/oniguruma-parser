# Tokenizer module ⛓️

Used by the [parser](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/src/parser/README.md) to convert Oniguruma pattern and flag strings into a list of tokens, as the first step in builing an AST.

> [!NOTE]
> This module is not exported by oniguruma-parser, since tokenization is considered an implementation detail of the parser.
