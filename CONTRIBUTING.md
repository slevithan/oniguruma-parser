# Contributing guide ðŸ§©

Thanks for lending a hand ðŸ‘‹

To understand how the code is structured, start with `src/index.ts`, which exports `toOnigurumaAst`. If you have questions before starting development, feel free to open an issue.

## Readmes

- [Main](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/README.md).
- [Optimizer](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/src/optimizer/README.md).
- [Traverser](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/src/traverser/README.md).
- [Parser](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/src/parser/README.md).
- [Tokenizer](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/src/tokenizer/README.md).

## Setup

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is used to manage dependencies. Install it with `npm install --global pnpm`.
- Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
- Build the package with `pnpm build`.

## Testing

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is used to test the codebase. Run `pnpm test` to start the test runner.
- Tests live in `./test`.
- Please include tests alongside changes and new features.

### Extending test coverage via other libraries

Test coverage for some modules is currently limited. The optimizer is an exception, since it includes tests for all optimizations. Fortunately, the optimizer's tests check end-to-end results that have gone through every part of this library: the tokenizer, parser, traverser, optimizer, and generator.

Part of the reason for the currently limited tests is that this library's tokenizer, parser, and traverser were originally built for and extracted from [Oniguruma-To-ES](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-to-es), which includes broader coverage with end-to-end tests for results that have gone through oniguruma-parser's tokenizer, parser, and traverser, as part of transpilation. So, if you're making major changes, it might be beneficial to also check that your changes don't break anything in Oniguruma-To-ES's tests. You can do so by cloning the Oniguruma-To-ES library, updating its `package.json` to point to your in-development copy of oniguruma-parser (by changing the dependency's version string to e.g. `"file:../oniguruma-parser"`), and then running `pnpm install` and `pnpm test`.

This library also receives extensive test coverage prior to new releases via the [tm-grammars](https://github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes) and [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) libraries. Between them, they test all parts of this library against ~55k real-world Oniguruma regexes that are included in the 220+ TextMate grammars provided by Shiki.

## Demo page

A demo REPL for the optimizer is included in this library and [available online](https://slevithan.github.io/oniguruma-parser/demo/). It shows results as you type and can be helpful for quick manual testing. You can also use it to test the generator by enabling the "Don't optimize (show generator output)" option. Other parts of this library can be tested on the demo page via the developer console.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The demo uses the latest published version of the library. To use local changes, you currently have to uncomment the relevant `<script>` tags in `./demo/index.html`. Run `pnpm build` to include your changes in the local bundle.

## Experimenting with Oniguruma

If you want to check how Oniguruma works with specific patterns and target strings, Ruby regex tester [rubular.com](https://rubular.com/) can sometimes be helpful. However, Ruby uses Onigmo, a fork of Oniguruma that has some syntax and behavior differences.

[Oniguruma-To-ES](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-to-es) (which is build on top of this library) includes a [script](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-to-es/blob/main/scripts/onig-match.js) for testing Oniguruma from the command line. After cloning its repo (and running `pnpm install`), you could run the following, for example:

```sh
$ node ../oniguruma-to-es/scripts/onig-match.js '\w' 'abc' no-compare
```

The `no-compare` option avoids comparing with regexes generated by Oniguruma-To-ES, so you just get the Oniguruma results.
